# My Data World
This is a collection of projects that trace my journey from early data analysis to advanced machine learning solutions. Each project focuses on a specific challenge, showcasing how I approach data problems from exploration to insights and modeling.  

## What’s Inside
- Early **data analysis** projects exploring SQL, visualization, and business reporting.  
- Applied **data science** cases: feature engineering, hypothesis testing, forecasting.  
- End-to-end **machine learning** workflows for prediction, classification, and explainability.  
- Experiments with **LLMs & agents** to automate research and business tasks.  

## Tech Stack
- **Core**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), SQL  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau  
- **ML & Forecasting**: Logistic Regression, kNN, Decision Trees, XGBoost, LightGBM, Darts, PCA, t-SNE, KMeans, PyTorch
- **NLP**: Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, N-grams, BERT 
- **Explainability**: SHAP, regression diagnostics  
- **Automation & Deployment**: LangChain, API integrations, hyperparameter tuning (Grid/Random/Hyperopt), Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Streamlit, FastAPI, Docker 


I view this repo as both a continuous **learning path** and a practical **portfolio**.
