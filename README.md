# My Data World
Welcome :) This is a collection of projects that trace my journey from early data analysis to advanced machine learning solutions. Each repository focuses on a specific challenge, showcasing how I approach data problems from exploration to insights and modeling.  

## What’s Inside
- Early **data analysis** projects exploring SQL, visualization, and business reporting.  
- Applied **data science** cases: feature engineering, hypothesis testing, forecasting.  
- End-to-end **machine learning** workflows for prediction, classification, and explainability.  
- Experiments with **LLMs & agents** to automate research and business tasks.  

## Tech Stack
- **Core**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), SQL  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau  
- **ML & Forecasting**: Logistic Regression, kNN, Decision Trees, XGBoost, LightGBM, Darts 
- **Explainability**: SHAP, regression diagnostics  
- **Automation**: LangChain, API integrations, hyperparameter tuning (Grid/Random/Hyperopt)  


I see this repo as both a **learning path** and a **portfolio**.

✨ *Always exploring, always finding better ways to turn data into decisions* ✨
