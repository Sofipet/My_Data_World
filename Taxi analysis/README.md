# Taxi Trip Record Analysis

## Introduction
The taxi industry generates a vast amount of data daily, offering a wealth of information that can be analyzed to uncover patterns and trends. This project focuses on analyzing taxi trip records to provide insights into various aspects of taxi operations. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we aim to understand factors influencing trip durations, fares, and demand patterns across different boroughs. The findings from this analysis can help inform strategic decisions for optimizing taxi services, improving customer satisfaction, and enhancing operational efficiency.

## Objectives

- Analyze taxi trip records to uncover trends and patterns in taxi usage.
- Identify key factors influencing taxi fares and trip durations.
- Present findings through visualizations and statistical analysis to provide actionable insights.

## Dataset Structure
Utilized a dataset containing taxi trip records, including details such as pickup and drop-off locations, trip durations, distances, and fares.

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning
- **Handling Missing Values**: Managed missing values through imputation or removal, depending on the context.
- **Data Transformation**: Performed necessary transformations for analysis.

### Data Analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA to understand the distribution and characteristics of the dataset.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performed statistical tests and calculated summary statistics to extract meaningful insights.
- **Visualization**: Created various visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib to illustrate the findings.

## Insights & Recommendations

- **Manhattan** has the **highest payments** for taxi rides, therefore it'll be a good idea to place more taxi cars in this district.
- The correlation between the **distance of the trip and the size of the tip** is not really high and trips could have been without tips at all, regardless of their distance.
- The highest **average tip** is for trips from Queens, but distribution is pretty unstable. For stability, Manhattan is the best option.
- Payment by **credit card** is mostly used and for much larger sums than in cash. Therefore, all taxis should be equipped with a **terminal**.
- The largest amount of payments occurs **from 5 to 7 p.m**. Thus, it is worth stimulating drivers to work actively during these hours.
- More attention should be paid to such boroughs as **Queens and Bronx** for as the distance of the trip increases, the fare increases too.

## Conclusion

The analysis of taxi trip records has provided valuable insights into various aspects of taxi operations. By understanding trip durations, fare distributions, and demand patterns across different boroughs, we can make informed decisions to enhance service delivery. Future work can build on these findings by incorporating additional data sources, such as weather and traffic conditions, to create more robust predictive models and interactive dashboards for real-time decision-making.
