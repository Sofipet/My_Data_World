The Central-West, North, and Northeast regions are expected to experience below-average rainfall and above-normal temperatures, which could negatively impact orange production. However, the South region is expected to have better conditions. Additionally, there have been reports of unusual high-temperature anomalies and intense rainfall events, which could also affect crop yields.\n",

      "Action Input: \"global demand for oranges 2024\"  \u001b[0m\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3mOrange tree branch. Global sales for oranges exported from all countries totaled US$5.13 billion in 2024 . Overall, the value of exported oranges decreased by an average -9% for all suppliers since 2020 when shipments of oranges were worth $5.64 billion. The flow of oranges was slower this week, due to the rain and the drop in temperatures in the South and Southeast. However, as activities in the industrial segment continue at a rapid pace, there were no major changes in values in the table market. Similarly, as the demand for oranges increases, more people want oranges than there are oranges available for them to buy. As a result, the price will rise until demand meets supply again. FrutPlanet will help you understand these variations. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been forced to suspend the launch of it’s controversial ‘Pandemic Treaty‘ due to pushback from millions of citizens who are demanding justice for the crimes perpetrated by the globalist elite during the pandemic. \"That generates demand for good overseas lemons. There are trade barriers concerning lemon imports from Argentine to Europe. Those are leading to uncertainty. That creates chances for exporting South African lemons to Europe. Trade flows have shifted.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe global demand for oranges in 2024 shows a complex picture. While the total value of exported oranges decreased by an average of 9% since 2020, there is an indication that demand is increasing, leading to a situation where more people want oranges than are available. This mismatch between demand and supply suggests that prices could rise, which may benefit exporters.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Historical Export Growth**: The average growth rate over the last two years (2023 and 2024) is approximately 7.65%. If this trend continues, we could expect a similar growth rate for 2025.\n",

      "2. **Weather Conditions**: The weather forecast indicates challenges in some regions due to below-average rainfall and high temperatures, which could negatively impact orange production. However, better conditions in the South may help mitigate some of these effects.\n",

      "3. **Inflation Rate**: The inflation rate of 4.87% is moderate, suggesting that while costs are rising, they are manageable, which is favorable for export activities.\n",
