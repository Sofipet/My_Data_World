## Contents

- [🏦 Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction](https://github.com/Sofipet/My_Data_World/tree/main/ML_Projects/Bank%20Marketing%20Campaign%20Prediction):  
  Predicted whether a client subscribes to a term deposit using UCI Bank Marketing data. Explored Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, kNN, and XGBoost. Best result: **XGBoost (AUROC ≈ 0.95)**, with macroeconomic indicators and campaign history as key drivers.

- [🏦 Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Sofipet/My_Data_World/tree/main/ML_Projects/Customer%20Churn%20Prediction):   
  Kaggle competition predicting bank customer churn. Compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, kNN, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Best result: **XGBoost (AUROC ≈ 0.94)**. Provided insights for targeted retention strategies.

- [🤖 LLM & Agent-Based Automation](https://github.com/Sofipet/My_Data_World/tree/main/ML_Projects/Prompts%20%26%20Agents%20in%20Langchain):  
  Explored Large Language Models (OpenAI, Mistral) and LangChain agents. Compared prompt responses, automated literature search with DuckDuckGo, and built a business forecasting assistant combining LLM reasoning with external data.

- [🛒 Retail Demand Forecasting](https://github.com/Sofipet/My_Data_World/tree/main/ML_Projects/Demand%20Forecasting):  
  Forecasted daily sales for one store–item pair (2013–2017). Benchmarked classical and ML methods. **Prophet achieved best accuracy (MAPE ≈ 23.8%)**, while XGBoost and RNNs showed scalable potential for larger datasets.

- [🚗 Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/Sofipet/My_Data_World/tree/main/ML_Projects/Car%20Price%20Prediction):  
  Built regression models to estimate used car prices in India. Applied feature encoding, correlation analysis, and OLS regression. **Horsepower, brand, and transmission** emerged as main predictors. Simplified model achieved high accuracy with fewer features.

- [🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Customer Personality Segmentation](https://github.com/Sofipet/My_Data_World/tree/main/ML_Projects/Customer%20Personality%20Segmentation):  
  Performed unsupervised segmentation on a marketing dataset using KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN, PCA, and t-SNE. Identified three distinct customer groups based on income, purchasing behavior, and engagement patterns.

- [✈️ LSTM Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/Sofipet/My_Data_World/tree/main/ML_Projects/LSTM%20Time%20Series%20Forecasting):  
  Implemented an LSTM model in PyTorch to forecast monthly airline passengers. Covered supervised windowing, model architecture, RMSE evaluation, loss curves, and prediction visualization. Compared hidden sizes and analyzed model limitations with short lookback windows.
