## Contents

- [üè¶ Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction](https://github.com/Sofipet/My_Data_World/tree/main/ML_Projects/Bank%20Marketing%20Campaign%20Prediction):  
  Predicted whether a client subscribes to a term deposit using UCI Bank Marketing data. Explored Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, kNN, and XGBoost. Best result: **XGBoost (AUROC ‚âà 0.95)**, with macroeconomic indicators and campaign history as key drivers.

- [üè¶ Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Sofipet/My_Data_World/tree/main/ML_Projects/Customer%20Churn%20Prediction):   
  Kaggle competition predicting bank customer churn. Compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, kNN, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Best result: **XGBoost (AUROC ‚âà 0.94)**. Provided insights for targeted retention strategies.

- [ü§ñ LLM & Agent-Based Automation](https://github.com/Sofipet/My_Data_World/tree/main/ML_Projects/Prompts%20%26%20Agents%20in%20Langchain):  
  Explored Large Language Models (OpenAI, Mistral) and LangChain agents. Compared prompt responses, automated literature search with DuckDuckGo, and built a business forecasting assistant combining LLM reasoning with external data.

- [üõí Retail Demand Forecasting](https://github.com/Sofipet/My_Data_World/tree/main/ML_Projects/Demand%20Forecasting):  
  Forecasted daily sales for one store‚Äìitem pair (2013‚Äì2017). Benchmarked classical and ML methods. **Prophet achieved best accuracy (MAPE ‚âà 23.8%)**, while XGBoost and RNNs showed scalable potential for larger datasets.

- [üöó Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/Sofipet/My_Data_World/tree/main/ML_Projects/Car%20Price%20Prediction):  
  Built regression models to estimate used car prices in India. Applied feature encoding, correlation analysis, and OLS regression. **Horsepower, brand, and transmission** emerged as main predictors. Simplified model achieved high accuracy with fewer features.
