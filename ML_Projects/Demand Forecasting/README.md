# ðŸ›’ Demand Forecasting for Retail Sales

Forecasting daily sales for **50 items across 10 stores (2013â€“2017)**.  
Goal: predict future sales using machine learning models.  
Metric: **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**.


## Exploratory Analysis
- Items and stores show clear **differences in sales levels**.  
- **Seasonality** is visible (yearly peaks), but daily data makes patterns noisy.  
- Weekly/monthly aggregation or log transform improves interpretability.  


## Baselines
- **NaiveSeasonal (weekly):** MAPE â‰ˆ 38%  
- **NaiveDrift:** MAPE â‰ˆ 69%  


## Models
- **Exponential Smoothing:** MAPE â‰ˆ 39% â€” smooth but misses sharp fluctuations.  
- **ARIMA / AutoARIMA:** similar to ES, no significant improvement without explicit seasonality.  
- **XGBoost (lags + calendar features):** MAPE â‰ˆ 27.6% â€” better fluctuation tracking.  
- **RNN (LSTM):** MAPE â‰ˆ 28.5% â€” promising, but needs more training.  
- **Prophet:** best model overall; captures trend + seasonality well, but does not scale (would require 500 models).  

**MAPE â‰ˆ 23.8% (val)**

**MAPE â‰ˆ 24.5% (backtest)**

## Key Insight
- **Prophet gives highest accuracy**, but not scalable.  
- **Global models (XGBoost, RNN)** are more practical for 500 series:  
  - One model for all time series.  
  - Faster training.  
  - Captures shared seasonal patterns.

## ðŸ’¡ Business Impact
Accurate sales forecasting enables retailers to:  
- **Optimize inventory management** â†’ reduce overstock and stockouts.  
- **Increase revenue** â†’ meet demand peaks without missing sales opportunities.  
- **Improve logistics planning** â†’ allocate resources (warehouses, deliveries) more efficiently.  
- **Enhance customer satisfaction** â†’ products available at the right time and place.  
- **Support strategic decisions** â†’ pricing, promotions, and supply chain planning.  

By reducing MAPE from ~38% (naive baseline) to ~24% (advanced models), the company gains a **~37% improvement in forecast accuracy**, directly impacting profitability and operational efficiency.
