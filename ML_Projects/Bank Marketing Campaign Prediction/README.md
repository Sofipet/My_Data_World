# 🏦 Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction  

This project is based on the **Bank Marketing Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
The goal is to predict whether a bank client will **subscribe to a term deposit (y = yes/no)** after a direct marketing campaign.

## 📂 Dataset Overview  

The dataset contains **41,188 records and 21 features** describing:  

- 👤 **Client Information**  
  - `age` (numeric)  
  - `job` (admin., blue-collar, management, retired, student, etc.)  
  - `marital` (divorced, married, single, unknown)  
  - `education` (basic, high school, professional, university, unknown)  
  - `default`, `housing`, `loan` (yes/no/unknown)  

- 📞 **Last Contact**  
  - `contact` (cellular, telephone)  
  - `month` (jan–dec), `day_of_week` (mon–fri)  
  - `duration` (numeric, seconds)  
    ⚠️ Strongly correlated with outcome but not available before the call → used for model comparison only.  

- 📊 **Campaign Details**  
  - `campaign` (# of contacts in this campaign)  
  - `pdays` (days since last contact; 999 = never contacted)  
  - `previous` (# of previous contacts)  
  - `poutcome` (outcome of previous campaign: success/failure/none)  

- 🌍 **Macroeconomic Indicators**  
  - `emp.var.rate` (employment variation rate)  
  - `cons.price.idx` (consumer price index)  
  - `cons.conf.idx` (consumer confidence index)  
  - `euribor3m` (3-month Euribor rate)  
  - `nr.employed` (number of employees)  

- 🎯 **Target**  
  - `y = yes` → client subscribed  
  - `y = no` → client did not subscribe

## ⚡ Challenges  

- Strong **class imbalance** (~11% subscribed).  
- High **multicollinearity** among macroeconomic variables.  
- Many **categorical features** with low-frequency categories.  

---

## 🛠️ Approach  

### 🔹 Preprocessing  
- One-hot encoding for categorical features  
- Scaling for numeric features (Logistic Regression, kNN)  
- Feature engineering:  
  - `campaign_log`  
  - `no_prev_contact` flag  
  - `age_cats` (age categories)  

### 🔹 Handling Imbalance  
- `class_weight='balanced'`  
- Threshold tuning for decision boundary  

### 🔹 Models  
- Logistic Regression  
- kNN  
- Decision Tree  
- XGBoost (tuned via **RandomizedSearchCV** and **Hyperopt**)  

### 🔹 Evaluation  
- **Primary metric:** ROC-AUC (robust under imbalance)  
- Additional metrics: Precision, Recall, F1

## 🔎 Insights  

- **Best model:** XGBoost (ROC-AUC ≈ 0.95).  
- Logistic Regression works as a **solid interpretable baseline**.  
- kNN underperforms due to high dimensionality.  
- SHAP analysis confirmed the importance of:  
  - Macroeconomic indicators (`emp.var.rate`, `nr.employed`)  
  - `duration` (though not usable in production)  
  - Seasonality (month, especially May campaigns)  
- Errors often concentrated in **May campaigns** and certain macro contexts.

## 🚀 Next Steps  

- Optimize **decision threshold** for Precision/Recall trade-off.  
- Experiment with **SMOTE** or undersampling for imbalance.  
- Test **stacking/ensembling** (LogReg + Trees + Boosting).
